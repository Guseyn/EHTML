**EHTML (Extended HTML)** is a library of custom HTML elements designed for various use cases.

Its primary goal is to minimize the need for client-side JavaScript by handling basic and routine tasks more efficiently through HTML alone.

A key feature of EHTML is simplifying AJAX operations, allowing you to perform them directly in HTML without writing JavaScript.

Additionally, EHTML treats HTML not only as a markup language but also as a templating language, enhancing its versatility and functionality.
