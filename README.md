**EHTML (or Extended HTML)** can be described as a set of custom elements that you can put on an HTML page for different purposes and use cases. The main idea and goal of this library is to provide convinient way to get rid of all your JavaScript code on the client side.

# Motivation

Every moment a new JavaScript framework borns here and there, and each of them claims that it's better than other ones for different irrelevant and stupid reasons. The main problem with all those frameworks is JavaScript. And I like this language very much, but it's painful to maintain. Mostly because it's difficult(or even impossible) to make it completely declarative on the client side. On the other hand, HTML is completely declarative language, it's easy to read and modify. So, why don't we try to replace JavaScript with HTML where it's possible (or just everywhere).

Thanks to HTML5 it's possible for relevant browsers. Read further and you'll see how you can do it.

# Usage

**EHTML** is very easy to include in your project. Just like jQuery, but all you need to do then is just to write HTML code, not JavaScript. Save [this file](https://github.com/Guseyn/EHTML/blob/master/ehtml.bundle.min.js) locally and use it:

```html
<head>
  <script src="/../js/ehtml.bundle.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
```
