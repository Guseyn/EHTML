# It's simple markdown that is loaded via e-markdown element.

Let's use here **bold text** and *italic text*. Let's insert code below:

```html
<e-html>
  <e-markdown data-src="/../simple.md"></e-markdown>
</e-html>
```

Let's insert table below:

|Framework|Score|
|--- |--- |
|**EHTML**|10/10|

Let's insert todo list below:

 - [x] This task is done
 - [ ] This is still pending

Seems like it works!
