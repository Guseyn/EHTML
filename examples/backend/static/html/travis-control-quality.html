</h1>
<div class="date">6 March 2019</div>
<p>Let&apos;s say you want to create an open source JS library and publish it to 
  <strong>npm</strong> and also release it to 
  <strong>GitHub</strong>. You can do it manually, but it&apos;s not convinient and you&apos;ll not be able to control quality of your project. I&apos;ve created a solution that can help to automatize the whole process and allows to catch problems in code before it&apos;s released. In this article, I&apos;ll share my variation of configuration that I use in 
  <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> and try to explain in detail how it works. You might find it very useful, especially if you use restricted master branch in your repo.
