        <p>In this article, I&apos;ll talk about <strong>callback hell</strong> again. But this time, I&apos;ll try to describe how I see this problem, and why I actually think that this is a problem. Also I&apos;ll explain why I think that abstractions such as <strong><code>Promise</code></strong> and <strong><code>async/await</code></strong> don&apos;t help us to structure our code in a better way. I&apos;ll demonstrate my solution that&apos;s based on ideas of declarative and pure object-oriented programming, which I&apos;m big fan of. And I&apos;ll show you why I think that declarative constructions is the only good way to write asynchronous code for big and complex applications.</p><a class="continue" href="/../posts/why-i-dont-use-promises-and-async-await?v=1.0.147">continue...</a>
